/**
 The `Syndication` class is the main Syndication SDK class.  It provides an interface for making requests to the Syndication server as well as packaging up the results for you into a `SynResults` (or subclass) object.
 
 ## Simple Syndication Usage
 
 To use the Syndication SDK, simply create a new `Syndication` object and make a request.
 
     #import <Syndication/SyndicationSDK.h>
 
     Syndication *syndication = [Syndication syndication];

 The above code will initialize a `Syndication` object with the default production Syndication API URL and set up any internal objects that need to be created.  You can store this object anywhere in your application.  You only need one `Syndication` object created to manage all of your API requests for your entire application.  All API requests will be made asynchronously and use block-based callbacks.
 
 The SDK uses block callbacks on success and failure.  To do a simple API search:
 
     [syndication searchMedia:@"smoking"
                      options:@{
                               @"max": @"10",
                               }
                      success:^(SynMediaResults *mediaResults) {
                          // Success!  Do something with our result set.
                      }
                      failure:^(SynMediaResults *mediaResults, NSError *error) {
                          // Failure.  Handle the NSError we received.
                      }
      ];
 
 See the various request methods below for different information you can request from the Syndication API.
 
 ## Handling Results
 
 Most of the `Syndication` request success blocks return some sort of `SynResults` result set object.  For example all of the 'Campaign Request Methods' return a `SynCampaignResults` object.
 
 All result objects returned have `SynResults` as the base class which responds to a base set of methods for walking through the result set returned from the API.
 
 You can get an array of results in either an `NSDictionary` key/value format or actual Objective C objects representing the type of data returned.
 
 For our example above, the `SynMediaResults` object could return an array of 2 `SynMedia` objects:  (Please note we make assumptions that the data set returned has at least 2 objects in it.  You should do your own boundary checking using the provided methods in `SynResults`):
 
     NSArray *mediaObjects = [mediaResults resultsObjects];
     NSLog(@"First media result name is: %@", mediaObjects[0].mediaName);
     NSLog(@"Second media result description is: %@", mediaObjects[1].mediaDescription);
 
 You can also have the results returned as an array of `NSDictionary` key/value:
 
     NSArray *mediaObjects = [mediaResults results];
     NSLog(@"First media result name is: %@", [mediaObjects[0] objectForKey:@"name"]);
     NSLog(@"Second media result description is: %@", [mediaObjects[1] objectForKey:@"description"]);
 
 If you need to get the total number of results returned in this `SynResults` object, use count:
 
     NSLog(@"The number of results returned was: %d.", [mediaResults count]);
 
 If you need to load more data into the result set (more results exist that need to be loaded):
 
     if ([mediaResults hasMore]) {
         [mediaResults loadMore:^(SynMediaResults *mediaResults) {
                            // Do something with the new media results returned
                        }
                        failure:^(SynMediaResults *mediaResults, NSError *error) {
                            // Handle the error
                        }
         ];
 
 For more information, see the documentation for the `SynResults` class.
